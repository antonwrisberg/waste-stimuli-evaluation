# Waste Stimuli Evaluation

This repository currently contains pilot/beta versions of my setup to evaluate waste items prior to experiments evaluating waste signage.

## Dimensions

The dimensions currently investigated are:

- Recognition (is the waste item recognisable?)
- Frequency (how often is the waste item disposed of?)
- Prototypicality (how well does the waste item align with individuals' instantions of waste fraction prototypes?)

### Examples

These links contain examples of how what evaluations could look like:
