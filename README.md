# Waste Stimuli Evaluation

This repository currently contains pilot/beta versions of my setup to evaluate waste items prior to experiments evaluating waste signage.

## Dimensions

The dimensions currently investigated are:

- Familiarity (is the waste item recognisable?)
- Frequency (how often is the waste item disposed of?)
- Prototypicality (how well does the waste item align with individuals' instantions of waste fraction prototypes?)

### Examples

These links contain examples of how these evaluations could look like:

**Recognition**

- [v0.0.1](dist/experiment/index.html?version=familiarity.0.0.1)
- [v0.0.2](dist/experiment/index.html?version=familiarity.0.0.2)
 
 **Frequency**

- [v0.0.1](dist/experiment/index.html?version=frequency.0.0.1)
- [v0.0.2](dist/experiment/index.html?version=frequency.0.0.2)

 **Prototypicality**

- [v0.0.1](dist/experiment/index.html?version=prototypicality.0.0.1)
- [v0.0.2](dist/experiment/index.html?version=prototypicality.0.0.2)

## Other evaluations

I have also made setups to evaluate other aspects of the waste. These include:

- Categorisation (measuring how long it takes to categorise items with default signage)
- Commonality (which items often occur in people's trash by recall)
- Odd-one-out (in triads, which item stands out)
- Signage familiarity (evaluating the familiarity of the waste fraction signs)

### Examples
